  Microsoft Co-Pilot was used to generate ideas of the content of the following notebook. That said, the notebook is mainly my own work, as I had to re-work the code the text in generated to meet my own needs (*The warning icon was sourced from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50544499/how-to-make-a-styled-markdown-admonition-box-in-a-github-gist)*).

## 1. Introduction

This project was created to fulfill an assessment requirement of Web Services and Applications 24-25: 8640, as part of the H.Dip in Science in Data Analytics.

Each week, following a series of lectures, an assignment was set, to demonstrate both learning and additional reading/research on the topics discussed in the lectures.

This repository is a collection of my weekly assignments, including some additional guidance and instruction on how to run each assignment/program.

***

## 2. The purpose of this project

As noted on the [assignment instructions](),

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure students can demonstrate the following:

1. Programmatically create plots and other visual outputs from data.
1. Design computer algorithms to solve numerical problems.
1. Create software that incorporates and utilises standard numerical libraries.
1. Employ appropriate data structures when programming for data-intensive applications.

## 3. How to get started

### Necessary software

In order to run the included files, you will need to ensure that you have access to the correct software. I would recommend downloading the following applications (ensuring sufficient space on your hard drive prior to installation):

1. [Anaconda](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf) (if Anaconda is too large, miniconda would also suffice).
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) (this is a code editor).

### **Additions to** *.gitignore*

A number of [additional files](https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/main/Global) were added to my .gitignore prior to running the programmes:

  1. python.gitignore
  2. macOS..gitignore
  3. VisualStudioCode.gitignore
  4. Linux.gitignore
  5. TeX.gitignore
  6. Vim.gitignore
  7. Windows.gitignore

## How to run the Notebook

### Using Visual Studio Code & Anaconda or GitHub Codespaces

**Clone the Repository**:

```ruby
   git clone https://github.com/Laura6826/PFDA-project
```

**Install the required packages**:

For a seamless executition, I would also recommend you have access to the below libraries prior to running the files. The libraries required to run this file (as noted below), can be installed with the following code:

```ruby
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

,or you can manually install each of the libraries below.+

```ruby
  import pandas as pd
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import seaborn as sns
  import scipy
```

***

### Open the notebook in Visual Studio Code

- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Open the `computer_infrastructure_assignments` folder.
- Open the folder associated with the assignment you wish to look at.

## 4. How to get help

I have attached below, a number of helpful links, should you wish to extrapolate on any of the methods used within this project.

1. [Anaconda](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf)
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
1. [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
1. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
1. [Matplotlib.py](https://matplotlib.org/)
1. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

Additionally, a number of links are embedded within the code, in areas that I found confusing, that should help should there be any difficulty.

## 5. How to contribute

As this project was created to fulfil an assessment requirement of the Principles of Data Analytics, as part of the H.Dip in Science in Data Analytics, no contributions will be allowed, in order to comply with ATU Policy on [Plagiarism](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2024-02/aqae022-academic-integrity-policy-1.pdf) and the [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.atu.ie/sites/default/files/2022-08/Student%20Code_Final_August_2022.pdf).

Should you find any errors or have any recommendations, please submit a pull request on GitHub. or just wish to contact that author, you can do so at <maxwell6826@gmail.com>.
